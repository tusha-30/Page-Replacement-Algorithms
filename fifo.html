	First In First Out (FIFO)
	<p>FIFO algorithm is the simplest of all the page replacement algorithms. In this, we maintain a queue of all the pages that are in the memory currently. The oldest page in the memory is at the front-end of the queue and the most recent page is at the back or rear-end of the queue.
</p>
<p>Whenever a page fault occurs, the operating system looks at the front-end of the queue to know the page to be replaced by the newly requested page. It also adds this newly requested page at the rear-end and removes the oldest page from the front-end of the queue.
</p>
<p>
Example: Consider the page reference string as 3, 1, 2, 1, 6, 5, 1, 3 with 3-page frames. Let’s try to find the number of page faults:
	</p>
	<p>Initially, all of the slots are empty so page faults occur at 3,1,2.
Page faults = 3
</p>
<p>
When page 1 comes, it is in the memory so no page fault occurs.
Page faults = 3
</p>
<p>
When page 6 comes, it is not present and a page fault occurs. Since there are no empty slots, we remove the front of the queue, i.e 3.
Page faults = 4
</p>
<p>
When page 5 comes, it is also not present and hence a page fault occurs. The front of the queue i.e 1 is removed.
Page faults = 5
</p>
<p>
When page 1 comes, it is not found in memory and again a page fault occurs. The front of the queue i.e 2 is removed.
Page faults = 6
</p>
<p>
When page 3 comes, it is again not found in memory, a page fault occurs, and page 6 is removed being on top of the queue
Total page faults = 7</p>
